I'm a graduate student in the data science program at the [University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/). A lifelong learner and problem solver. I have over 4 years of professional experience working with data and delivering business value. I enjoy all aspects of machine learning from problem definition, data exploration, insight generation to model building, deploying and monitoring. Passionate about data-enabled decision making.

I'm enthusiastic about all things Cricket/ Football. An avid supporter of [Real Madrid](https://www.realmadrid.com/en) and the [Men in Blue](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/India_national_cricket_team).
